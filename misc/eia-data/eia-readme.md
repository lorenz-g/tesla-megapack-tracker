On the Website  here it says: https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/

```
Data for June 2021	Release Date: August 24, 2021 Next Release Date: September 24, 2021 
- means that the files I downloaded on 2021-09-22 have data for June 2021

```

TODOS:
- on the detail page mention the first time the project appeared in a eia report
- if the eia_plant_id is set, then automatically add the estimated go live and status if it is missing
  - go live and status should never be set if there is a eia plant id
  - if there is a match, check that the status / mw are the same in both 

- [x] on the eia data, add a checkmark if the data is also shown on our map
- [x] add the link to the individual pae to the checkmark
